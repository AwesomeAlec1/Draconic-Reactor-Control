# Draconic-Reactor-Control
The purpose of this program is to provide user-friendly controls for the Draconic Reactor from the Minecraft mod Draconic Evolution.

It works using OpenComputers and Lua to control the reactor's flux gates using precise calculations derived directly from DE's source code to provide exact control over the reactor's temperature and shield strength, as well as the ability to automatically shut down the reactor when its fuel is low.

Additionally, the program includes a "chaos mode", which will run the reactor as hot (and as a result, consume fuel) as fast as possible with the express purpose of converting fuel to chaos. NOTE: THIS REQUIRES *STAGGERING* AMOUNTS OF ENERGY TO KEEP FROM EXPLODING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
